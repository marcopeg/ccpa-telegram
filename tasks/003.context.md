The goal is to inject into the AI's context some information as part of the prompt that is passed. Ideally, this will reduce the amount of tools calls and speed up the resolution of the user request.

## EXAMPLE:
Most of the personal assistants that we can do with this setup may need or rely on the message timestamp as part of the information. This is also great so that the user can queue messages that will be lazily executed when the bot comes to life (think a time tracking app, food logger...)

## CONFIGURATION:

The context should be defined in the `ccpa.config.json` file per project, expanding the "globals.context":

```json
{
    "globals": {
        "context": {
            "messageID": "${bot.messageID}",
            "messageTimestamp": "${bot.messageTimestamp}",
            "localTimestamp": "#{date +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"}"
        }
    },
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "project1"
        },
        {
            "name": "project2",
            "context": {
                "foo": "bar",
                "localTimestamp": "#{date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\"}"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, project1 will inherith the full context from globals, project2 will get the same but it will expand it with the "foo" key and will override the "localTimestamp" with a custom date format.

## Context Serialization

The context should be serialized as a k/v store and injected into the user request that is passed to Claude:

```prompt
# Context
- k1: v1
- k2: v2

# User Message
{user message or transcription}
```

IMPORTANT: during the refinement of this task you need to research what is the best strategy to pass down this context

## Default Context

When initializing a new config file project with the "init" cli method, a standard default context should contain all the possible parameters from the telegram bot (so to provide a comprehensive context of the user message metadata), plus the computer local time in a standard format that also contains the timezone.

You need to come up with standard keys for these information so that the user can esily reference those in their message or in CLAUDE.md

Example:
If CLAUDE.md contains the line "save the info based on the message's id", Claude Code should be able to reconcile that to the property name that you have decided.

## Variable Subtitution

The pattern `${string}` should
