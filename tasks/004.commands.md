I want to find a way to hook into Telegram APIs and surface slash commands into Telegram UI.

## Question: 
Is there a way to expose a list of /command from a project to the connected bot so that it is somehow possible to see the list of available commands from the TelegramUI?

## Implementation:
When receiving a message, quickly check if it starts with a /command. If so, check if an implementation exists in `.ccpa/commands/*.mjs` - the ".ccpa" in this context is the project's .ccpa folder. Commands are project-specific. 

If a project-specific command is not found, then we fallback to the `.ccpa/commands/{command}.mjs` relative to the `ccpa.config.json` file so that we can support global commands for all projects. 

If no match is found, then the message should be passed to the claude as it is so that it can match a skill.
