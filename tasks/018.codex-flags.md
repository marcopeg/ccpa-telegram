I want to extend the engine configuration with codex-specific options so to better manage the access permissions of the engine:

From a previous conversation:

```
Yes—Codex CLI has flags/config that expand what I can do, but in this session they’re locked down by how your host (Hal/CCPA runtime) started Codex (approval policy = “never”, and restricted sandbox).

From codex --help, the relevant knobs are:

- --sandbox read-only|workspace-write|danger-full-access
- --ask-for-approval untrusted|on-request|never
- --add-dir <DIR> (adds extra writable roots)
- --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox (no sandbox at all; very risky)
- -c key=value (overrides config, e.g. via ~/.codex/config.toml)

So: if you run Codex yourself, you can start it with something like --sandbox danger-full-access (or adjust ~/.codex/config.toml). But for the Codex instance embedded in your current bot/runtime, you’d need to change the launch command/config there—there isn’t an in-chat flag you can give me to elevate permissions mid-session.
