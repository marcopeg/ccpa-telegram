I want to add global /commands for managing git inside a project.

## Commands

- `/git_init` -> checks if there is a git repo and if not it initializes one and runs first commit automatically
- `/git_status` -> runs `git status` to understand the current situation
- `/git_commit {message}` -> runs `git add + git commit` at once, picks the commit message from the message context or runs a prompt to generate it from the open changes if no explicit message is passed
- `/git_clean {file_name}` -> reverts the changes the file name

It would be nice to understand how to support a confirm step through Telegram API so that the commands can send back a confirm request explaining what is about to happen.

All these commands should be implemented within the codebase, they are not project specific but should be shipped with the @marcopeg/hal package.

They are pushed to the bot via Telegram api together with all the other commands only when the feature is enabled for this specific bot.

## Config

The support for git in a project is optional and should be enabled by config flag (this config can also be in the globals thoug):

```json
{
    "git": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```
