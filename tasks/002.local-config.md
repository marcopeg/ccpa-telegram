Update the CLI so that when loading a configuration file `ccpa.config.json` it also looks for a `ccpa.config.local.json` that should be gitignored and extends the basic configuration.

The "local" version should be used to store secrects that are not supposed to be shared.

Also, support variable substitution from environment variables in the final configuration:

```json
{
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "Foobar",
            "telegram": {
                "botToken": "${FOOBAR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN}"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, the configuration that was created by aggregating the `ccpa.confg.json` with its optional extension `ccpa.config.local.json` contains a variable substitution.

The env var `FOOBAR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` should be searched in the bash's context, but it should first look for a ".env" or ".env.local" environment files that may contain the information.

The order of resolution is

1. .env.local
2. .env
3. bash context
