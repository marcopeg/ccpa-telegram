This task is to investigate the complexity of adding support for different AI engines like:
- Codex (openai)
- GitHub Copilot (microsoft)
- OpenCode

Can we easily switch the support adding the engine as part of the configuration?

Is it possible/feasible to add a custom init flag so to support different folder initialization scripts based on the engine? Eg. `npx telegrapp init --engine codex` - this should use AGENTS.md instead of CLAUDE.md inside the project folder.
