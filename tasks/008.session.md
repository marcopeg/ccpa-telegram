Goal: support engine session continuity in a configurable way, with defaults that preserve current behavior, and add explicit session-renewal commands.

Today, Claude keeps session continuity via stored session IDs (`--resume <id>`), while Copilot currently starts disconnected runs. This task introduces a unified config switch and consistent renewal UX.

## 1) Session config

Add engine-level settings:

```json
"engine": {
    "name": "copilot",
    "session": true,
    "sessionMsg": "hi!"
}
```

Requirements:

- `engine.session` applies globally/per-project for all engines.
- Default for `engine.session` is `true` when omitted.
- `engine.sessionMsg` is configurable globally and per-project.
- Default for `engine.sessionMsg` is `"hi!"`.

### Behavior by engine

Each engine implements its own session strategy:

**Claude:**

- `session=true`: keep current behavior — store session ID in `session.json`, pass `--resume <id>` on subsequent calls.
- `session=false`: do not pass `--resume` flag; do not store or read session IDs. Every call is anonymous/fresh.

**Copilot:**

- `session=true`: pass `--continue` flag (continues most recent session; no session ID storage needed). Replace the current `--resume <sessionId>` logic — Copilot does not expose session IDs, so `--continue` is the correct mechanism.
- `session=false`: do not pass `--continue`. Each call starts a new disconnected session.

**Other engines (Codex, OpenCode):**

- Accept the `session` and `sessionMsg` config values without error. If no engine-specific session behavior is implemented yet, do not break existing behavior.

## 2) Session renewal commands

Add 2 built-in commands:

- `/new` — description: `start a new session`
- `/clean` — description: `start a new session`

Both are session-only resets: they do **not** wipe uploads, downloads, or the full user directory.

### Renewal flow by engine

**Claude (passive reset):**

- Delete `session.json` for the user so the next regular message starts a fresh session.
- No engine call is made during the `/new` or `/clean` command itself.
- Reply to user: `"New session started."`

**Copilot (active reset):**

- Send one Agent call with `engine.sessionMsg` (default `"hi!"`) **without** the `--continue` flag. This forces Copilot to start a brand-new session.
- Reply to user: the engine's actual response to the `sessionMsg`.

**Other engines:**

- Fall back to passive reset (delete `session.json`, reply with static confirmation).

### Important

- `/new` and `/clean` must still run their renewal flow even when `engine.session=false`.

## 3) Telegram command manifest

Whenever commands are published to Telegram (`setMyCommands`, including watcher updates), always include these built-in commands:

- `/start` — welcome message
- `/help` — show help
- `/clear` — clear conversation history
- `/new` — start a new session
- `/clean` — start a new session

Then merge any loaded project/global commands and skills on top.

## 4) Acceptance criteria

- With Copilot + `session=true`, consecutive messages use `--continue` to stay in the same engine session.
- With Copilot + `session=false`, consecutive messages do not pass `--continue`; each is a new session.
- With Claude + `session=true`, session IDs are stored and `--resume <id>` is passed (current behavior).
- With Claude + `session=false`, `--resume` flag is not sent; session.json is not read or written.
- `/new` and `/clean` for Claude: delete `session.json`, reply with static message, no engine call.
- `/new` and `/clean` for Copilot: send `sessionMsg` without `--continue`, reply with engine output.
- `/new` and `/clean` work even when `engine.session=false`.
- Command suggestions in Telegram always include `/start`, `/help`, `/clear`, `/new`, `/clean` after startup and after every command reload.
