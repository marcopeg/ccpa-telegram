This project provides a CLI to run a telegram bot and connect it to a Claude Code instance on a given folder "cwd".

## Multi Project Setup

GOAL:
Turn this into a multi-bot multi-folder project.

CWD:
When running this cli, it should keep looking for "ccpa.config.json" but that configuration should have a different shape:

```json
{
    "globals": {
        "access": {
            "allowedUserIds": []
        },
        "claude": {
            "command": "claude"
        },
        "logging": {
            "level": "info"
        },
        "rateLimit": {
            "max": 10,
            "windowMs": 60000
        }
    },
    "projects": [
        {
            "cwd": "./project1",
            "telegram": {
                "botToken": ""
            },
            "access": {
                "allowedUserIds": []
            },
            "claude": {
                "command": "claude"
            },
            "logging": {
                "level": "info",
                "persist": true,
                "flow": false
            },
            "rateLimit": {
                "max": 10,
                "windowMs": 60000
            }   
        },
        {
            "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/project2",
            "telegram": {
                "botToken": ""
            } 
        },
    ]
}
```

Main differences:

1. The configuration exposes the "projects" key that contains a **LIST** of ccpa configurations as they were before.

2. Each configuration contains the "cwd" mandatory param that is the relative or absolute path to the folder that should be connected to that specific bot.

3. the "logging" has a "persist (boolean)" flag. When "true", the logging should **ALSO** be stored in a file-system under the `.ccpa/{project-slug}/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.txt` file.

4. the "logging" has a "flow (boolean) flag (defaults to true). If the flag is set to false, the logs should not flow to the terminal.

5. the "globals" root config contains ccpa-compatible configs that are meant to be used by all the projects. If a project doesn't define a specific setting, it will be sourced from the "globals", if it's not there, then it will use a default value.

## Mandatory Settings

These two settings must be set for each bot and must be unique.
The CLI should validate the configuration at boot time.

- projects.{n}.cwd
- projects.{n}.telegram.botToken

## Defaults

- globals.claude.command = "claude"
- globals.logging.level = "info"
- globals.logging.flow = true
- globals.logging.persist = false
- globals.rateLimit.max = 10
- globals.rateLimit.windowMs = 60000
