If "hal.config.json" does not offer an engine setting, you need to test for the engine availability on the local system with this priority order:

- open code
- claude code
- copilot
- cursor
- codex

The first engine that is available as cli contex should be adopted.

make sure you log the exploration attepts and the choice in the end.

NOTE: when testing for the engine availability, always try to run a simple prompt like "hi" to make sure the engine is able to come back with an answer.
