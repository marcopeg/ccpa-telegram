We need to add new global command "/model" (with the HAL project):

This command should present the list of the available models for the project's specific engine (even if the engine name comes from the global configuration).

I don't know if we need to keep a hard-coded list within the codebase and update it via release, or if an api exists for the different models so that we can get the available values dynamically. If we must hard code the list, we need always to show the last update date for that list.

Ideally, we should be able to use telegram's API to show a UI with multiple choices (buttons?) so that the user can quicly pick the desired model.

Ideally, for each entry we should show the model name and a brief description of the capabilities and usecases.

The current model should be somehow highlighed.

When the user chooses the model, HAL should update its own configuration setting the new model name in the project's specific section of the configuration.

NOTE: we should do this task after the 015 (hot reload) so that the system should automatically react to the change in configuration.
