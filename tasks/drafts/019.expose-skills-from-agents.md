We started this project focusin on Claude Code, but now we are moving to different engines implementations.

Right now, we expose the `.claude/skills` in the `/help` and `/start` command (via placeholder) and also we publish it towards Telegram API so that they can be listed as slash commands from the UI.

We need to move this implementation inside the engine adapter, because different engines should look into different places:

## GitHub

- .agents/skills
- .github/commands

## Codex

- .agents/skills

## Othesr

we need to refine this task and do web search to figure out what are good defaults for the different engines we want to support.
