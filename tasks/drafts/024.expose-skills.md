# 024 — Expose skills across engines

Status: draft

## Context
HAL currently has partial/legacy logic for exposing skills and commands, with behavior historically centered around Claude conventions. We need a consistent engine-level approach so each engine adapter can discover, monitor, and expose project skills correctly.

The preferred baseline is the standard skills layout:
- `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`

However, engine-specific conventions may differ, so we also need targeted research of official docs for each supported engine and then document the agreed behavior in `README.md`.

## Goal
Implement engine-adapter-level skill discovery and exposure so that:
- skill sources are identified per engine,
- skill changes can be monitored,
- skills are surfaced in `/help` placeholders,
- and skill-derived commands are pushed to Telegram Bot API when applicable.

## Scope
- Define per-engine skill discovery defaults and fallback behavior.
- Move/centralize skill resolution logic to engine adapter boundaries (or engine-specific resolver integration).
- Support the `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md` convention as primary where possible.
- Wire discovered skills into:
  - `/help` placeholder rendering,
  - Telegram command exposure/push pipeline.
- Add/update documentation in `README.md` with engine-specific behavior and rationale.
- Perform web research against official/reliable engine docs before finalizing defaults.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Skill discovery is implemented at engine adapter level (or clearly adapter-owned integration point), not hardcoded to a single engine path.
- `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md` is supported as the default convention whenever compatible.
- `/help` output includes discovered project skills consistently per engine.
- Telegram command publication includes skill-based commands per engine where supported.
- Engine-specific discovery rules are documented in `README.md`.
- Any unsupported/unknown engine behavior is explicitly documented with conservative defaults.

## Notes
- Prefer explicit, testable mapping of `engine -> skill sources`.
- Known engine-specific paths to investigate: `.github/commands` (GitHub engine), `.agents/skills` (Codex engine).
- Keep behavior backward compatible for existing projects whenever possible.
- See plan: [024.expose-skills.plan.md](./024.expose-skills.plan.md).
