# 023 — Sort commands in /help and Telegram UI

Status: draft

## Context
Commands should be grouped and ordered consistently in both the `/help` placeholder output and the Telegram command menu/UI.

Required groups and order:
1. Project commands
2. Project skills
3. User commands (from `.hal/commands` top level)
4. System commands (provided by HAL)

## Scope
- Ensure command lists are grouped and sorted by the required order in `/help` output.
- Ensure command lists exposed to Telegram UI are grouped and sorted by the same required order.
- Research Telegram Bot API support for command sorting/grouping in the native UI and document the constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `/help` displays commands grouped and ordered as specified.
- Telegram command menu reflects the required order as much as the Telegram platform allows.
- Any Telegram limitation on grouping/sorting is explicitly documented in the implementation notes and/or task comments.
- Existing command functionality remains unchanged.
