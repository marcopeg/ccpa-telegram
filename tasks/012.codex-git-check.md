# Codex: Make skip-git-repo-check an explicit config option

## Context

Codex CLI refuses to run unless the working directory is a "trusted" directory (typically a Git repo). Otherwise it exits with:

```
Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified.
```

To unblock usage from Hal (e.g. when the project dir is not a Git repo or not considered trusted), we currently pass `--skip-git-repo-check` unconditionally in the Codex adapter. That bypasses Codex’s safety check for all Codex users.

## Goal

Make this an **explicit engine-level config option** so that:

- **Default is `false`** — do not pass `--skip-git-repo-check` unless the user opts in.
- Users who need to run Codex outside a trusted/Git directory must **explicitly enable** the option in config.

## Requirements

1. **Config**
   - Add an engine-level option, e.g. `engine.skipGitRepoCheck` (or similar name).
   - Type: boolean.
   - Default: `false`.
   - Resolve from project → globals → default (same pattern as `engine.session` / `engine.sessionMsg`).

2. **Codex adapter**
   - Pass `--skip-git-repo-check` to the Codex CLI **only when** the resolved option is `true`.
   - When the option is `false` (default), do not pass the flag (Codex will enforce its trusted-directory check).

3. **Other engines**
   - Ignore the option (no-op for Claude, Copilot, OpenCode). No need to document in their sections if we keep it Codex-specific; otherwise add a single line that the option is only used by Codex.

4. **Docs**
   - Document the new option in README (globals/projects engine table and Codex section): name, default `false`, meaning (allow running Codex outside a trusted/Git directory when `true`).

## Acceptance criteria

- With `engine.skipGitRepoCheck` omitted or `false`, Codex is invoked **without** `--skip-git-repo-check` (current Codex safety check applies).
- With `engine.skipGitRepoCheck: true`, Codex is invoked **with** `--skip-git-repo-check`.
- Config schema and resolution support the new field; README documents it.
