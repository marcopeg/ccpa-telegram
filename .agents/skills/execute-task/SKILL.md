Focus on the task provided by the user. Read the task description, the plan and any related files (code, config, prompts, etc.) to fully understand the context and the requirements.

Then, execute the task as specified in the plan. This may involve writing code, configuring systems, or performing other actions as needed to complete the task successfully.

Make sure to follow the instructions in the plan carefully, and refer back to the task description and related files as needed to ensure that you are meeting all requirements and delivering the expected results.

When a plan step or phase is completed, flag it as done in the plan document and move on to the next step or phase until the entire task is completed. If you encounter any issues or need clarification, refer back to the task description and related files, and if necessary, ask for additional information from the user.

Annotate your actions and decisions in the plan file as you execute the task, providing explanations for why you are taking certain steps or making specific choices. This will help ensure that your execution is transparent and that the user can understand the rationale behind your actions.
